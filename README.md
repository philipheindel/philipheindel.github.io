# My Personal Web Page
As is fairly obvious, this is my personal webpage. It's meant as something of a fancy, web resume. 
## Introduction
The goal of this project is write my webpage **entirely** in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No libraries or frameworks or any external resources are to be used in the site itself. A considerable portion of the CSS and JavaScript was written with the help of StackOverflow, W3Schools, Fireship.io, CSS-Tricks, and many other sources found via Google. 
## Plan
The plan for this project will consist of three stages: Design, Deconstruct, and Develop.
### Design
The design phase is where I will use a UI design tool such as Figma to design how I want the site to ultimately look like. In addition to the look, this will also be where I determine how I want the site to behave and function. This will act as an end goal for the project.
#### **Design Deliverables:**
- [ ] Full site UI design
- [ ] Document outlining all site interactions
- [ ] Document outlining all site behaviors
### Deconstruct
The deconstruction phase is where I will use the design created in the previous phase to break the UI into smaller, logical components. Additionally, I will be writing up a list of functions and their purpose in the site as a whole.
#### **Deconstruction Deliverables:**
- [ ] Document outlining site region breakdown
- [ ] Document outlining and describing all functions and their purposes
### Develop
The development phase is probably the most straight forward. In this phase, I will take the UI from the Design phase and the functions outlined in the Deconstruction phase, and turn them into actual code. This is essentially the part where the site is actually developed.
#### **Development Deliverables:**
- [ ] Functioning site
